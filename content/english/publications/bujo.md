Bullet Journaling helped me through a lot of difficult phases in my life, independent of whether they were personal, educational or working related. In this short article I want to show you how you can use (Bullet) Journaling in your everyday life to get a better grip on what’s happening and what you want to happen. This article is loosely based on my talk I gave at a pyLadies Berlin meetup in March this year.
