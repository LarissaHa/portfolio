    "description":"Luanas Schreibstube is my private blog where I collect thoughts about books and writing. I love to invent fictional characters and let them live in my stories. When I'm not writing, I'm probably reading: I like all kinds of Science Fiction or Fantasy, but also contemporary literature.",
