These systems (like ILIAS in the actual case) can be customized to individual needs and accessed and used with an ordinary browser. Within this online e-learning system, lecturers, tutors, and students are able to communicate and work together in various different ways. All this actions and connections between users, as they are happening online, are recorded and stored and can be therefore used for data analysis.",

Therefore I will have a look at data from the European Social Survey (ESS) from round 1 and 6 because they both include a battery of survey questions about voluntary participation.",
